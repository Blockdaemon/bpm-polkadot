# Vendoring is a bit controversial. I'm doing it for these reasons:
#
# - Being able to build without internet
# - Avoid dependencies dissapearing (https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/)
# - Avoid attacks by injecting malicious code in dependencies (https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/26/npm_repo_bitcoin_stealer/)
#
# The last point is admittedly unlikely because collision attacks with sha1 are still very expensive
# but with potentially lots of money at stake we shouldn't take changes.

# Linus Torvalds: There's a big difference between using a cryptographic hash for things like security signing,
#                 and using one for generating a 'content identifier' for a content-addressable system like git.
