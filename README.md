This repository contains a WIP Polkadot plugin for BPM.

It currently supports:

- Watcher nodes
- Experimental validator nodes
- Sending blockheight, best peer blockheight and peer count to the backend
- Sending logs to the backend

# How to build it

Just run make which will automatically create versioned binaries for Linux and OSX
Usage

Once built, the plugin can be used directly by calling `./binaries/skeleton-<version>-<os>-amd64` or, once the plugin repository is implemented it can be uploaded to the repository and used with bpm.

# How to run it

To use the plugin directly:

1. Build the binary or download a pre-build binary from https://runner-test.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/polkadot-0.4.1-linux-amd64
2. Create the node directory: `mkdir -p ~/.blockdaemon/nodes/polkadot-ms2/`
3. Copy the node configuration file: `cp node_example.json ~/.blockdaemon/nodes/polkadot-ms2/node.json`
4. Copy the certificates and keys directory: `cp -r beats ~/.blockdaemon/beats`
5. Run through the plugin lifecycle:

```
./polkadot-0.2.0-linux-amd64 create-configurations polkadot-ms2
./polkadot-0.2.0-linux-amd64 start polkadot-ms2
```

This will create the secrets, configuration and finally start the docker container with the blockchain node. 

You should now see a running multiple docker container: `docker ps`

# To remove it

```
./polkadot-0.2.0-linux-amd64 remove --purge polkadot-ms2
```
